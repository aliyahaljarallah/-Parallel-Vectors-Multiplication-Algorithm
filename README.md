# -Parallel-Vectors-Multiplication-Algorithm
This project examines how parallel computing can speed up the calculation of Euclidean distance between vectors, a common operation in data analysis and machine learning. We tested three methods: a simple sequential approach, OpenMP for shared-memory systems, and MPI for distributed systems.
